# Unblocked Games website

## Description:
Another unblocked games website. Though this one looks like it was copied straight from tag-2, I hand coded the styles and files (I only took the games from other websites). I sometimes change the address and name to counter getting blocked by Go Guardian. This website is maintained and prioritized locally, so some features may not work in your area.

## Website features:
* Redirects to Google drive after 200 seconds ðŸ•™
* (soon to be public) Search tab ðŸ”Ž
* Fulscreen for games by pressing the fullscreen button or by pressing 'f' â‡±
* Favicon and title desgised as an animal facts website ðŸ¤«
* Includes banger games like **Super Mario 64**, **Super Hot**, **Drift Hunters**, **Happy Wheels**, **Hole.io**, **Half Life**, and **Eaglercraft** ðŸ¤˜
* Ad free games for ever (I know, i'm so nice.) ðŸš«
* Quick Switch for redirecting to Google Drive manually by pressing 'q' on the home page âš¡

## Usage:
Just go to the current link and play whatever you want. If you want to fork, please give me credit. I worked really hard on this.

## Contributing:
